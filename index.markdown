# The London Clojure Group

We are people who live and/or work in London and are interested in programming in [Clojure](http://clojure.org/).

Currently our main activities are 2 [monthly dojos](dojos.html) where
we help one another to learn Clojure and provide a chance to code that
our day jobs may not allow and talks at
[SkillsMatter](https://skillsmatter.com/explore?q=clojure).

We also organise occasional lunches, hack days, reading groups,
sprints and other events.

If you have an idea of an event you'd like to organise let us know on
the mailing list or in person. We'll help you to put on the event. All
of our events and activities are covered by our
[Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.html) to make them friendly and
welcoming to everyone.

## Upcoming events

We maintain a calendar of London Clojurians events [here](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=otfrom.com_pkatmn3n1ff8l5bvls3cnc01mc%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Europe/London).

### Talks

We hold talks at
[SkillsMatter](https://skillsmatter.com/explore?sort_by=asc&q=clojure&location=&content=meetups)
on the first Tuesday of the month every month except January and December.

If you would like to speak at our monthly event, please <a href="mailto:london-clojurians-organisers@googlegroups.com
?Subject=Volunteer%20Speaker" target="_top">email the London Clojurian organisers</a> 

### Dojos

We currently run two standard [dojos](dojos.html) per month, which are kindly
hosted by uSwitch and ThoughtWorks. These dojos concentrate on solving
programming kata in one session.

We also host an 'episodal' dojo, the Progressive Clojure Dojo (ProCloDo), that is building a
Clojure/Clojurescript web application over a number of months. This is
hosted at [SkillsMatter](https://skillsmatter.com/groups/87-london-clojure-community)

The dojo sign up pages and details will be announced closer to the
events on the
[mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/london-clojurians).

#### uSwitch Dojo

Dojos at uSwitch are on the second Monday of the month.

#### ThoughtWorks Dojo

Dojos at ThoughtWorks are on the last Tuesday of the month, except
December.

#### ProCloDo

The Progressive Clojure Dojo is currently building a
Clojure/Clojurescript web application over a period of months. The
intention is to give Clojurians who don't write much/any Clojure in
their day job to explore the disciplines involved in building, testing
and deploying an application. Keep an eye on the London Clojurians
[SkillsMatter](https://skillsmatter.com/groups/87-london-clojure-community)
page for sign up details.

### Yearly Conference
