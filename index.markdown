# The London Clojure Group

We are people who live in London and are interested in programming in [Clojure](http://clojure.org/).

Currently our main activity is a [monthly dojo](dojos.html) where we help one another to learn Clojure and provide a chance to code that our day jobs may not allow (although our goal must be to bring the light of Clojure to our benighted workplaces).

The dojos are sometimes proceeded by lightning talks and we do intend to have more talk sessions soon.

## Talk to us

There is [London Clojurions Google group](http://groups.google.com/group/london-clojurians) where you discuss any projects you are working on, any events the user group should be putting on and how much you &hearts; Emacs.
