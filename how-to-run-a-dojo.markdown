# How to run a dojo

Running dojos is a lot of fun. It is also really easy. No one has to
prepare a talk or a subject for the night. The most important thing is
that everyone has fun. After that if people learn some clojure, then
that is a great bonus. But the fun has to come first to keep people
coming back.

Here is a simple(?) step by step guide. If you are unsure about how to
be an MC, then just watch some bits of The Muppet Show and do what
Kermit does.

All of the below are suggestions and guidelines, not rules. Do what
works. This seems to be working reasonably well for us. YMMV.

* Find your hosts, say hello. Make sure everyone is happy. Make sure
  newcomers feel welcome.

* Make sure the food is arriving/has arrived.

* Make sure there is enough to drink (beer, wine, soft drinks).

* Get the projector for show and tell.

* Set up a whiteboard. Write “Dojo Ideas” at the top. Put “Roman
  Numeral Calculator” as the first idea to avoid the tyranny of the
  blank whiteboard.

* Greet fellow clojurians, eat food, drink whatever until 7PM.

* Think of a silly question for the kick off.

* At 7PM round everyone up for the kick off.

* Thank everyone for coming, the sponsors for hosting and your fellow
  organisers.

* Get everyone to introduce themselves, say how long they’ve been
  doing clojure for and answer a silly question.

* Tell everyone that the dojo is a safe place to be a new to clojure
  and to try new things and learn things. Let experienced people know
  it is a great place to be surprised by things they didn’t know and
  to think hard about what they’ve learned and share it with everyone.

* Vote on the task for the dojo. In the 1st round people can vote for
  more than one idea. Do run offs if necessary. In run off rounds you
  can ask people to only vote for one idea. Votes are approximate,
  unless it is important that they aren’t. Ties in voting are OK. You
  can do more than one thing. Teams are sovereign. If a team wants to
  work and present on something other than what was voted on then that
  is fine.

* Make sure there are enough clojure environments/experienced team
  members to go around. Get them up front to act as the 1st member of
  each team if needed.

* Divide into teams of 4-6 people. Teams of 4 are better, but 3 is too
  small.

* Get the teams to spread out and start.

* Do the dojo! This should be enough time for everyone to have 10
  minutes at the keyboard and 20-30 mins of discussion. Usually 1 hour
  20 minutes.

* Tell people when each 10 minute period is up and remind teams to
  rotate. Everyone should write at least 1 working line of clojure
  code that evening, even if it is just a (println “foo”).

* Make sure every team understands the problem, is able to get on to
  wifi, isn’t struggling too much.

* Swap more or less experienced people from one team to another if a
  particular team is struggling too much. Ask them if they are still
  having fun first though. If they are having fun, then leave them
  alone.

* After 80 minutes or so, round everyone up for show and tell at the
  projector.

* Do show and tell. Thank everyone. Clean up. Go to the pub!
